## Data Source

The sales data used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. Please ensure you comply with the dataset's license and terms of use. You can download the raw data from Kaggle and place it in the `data/raw/` directory as `sales_data.csv`.

# Sales Analytics Pipeline

Sales Analytics Pipeline is a professionally structured, open-source framework for end-to-end sales data analytics, leveraging Python and PostgreSQL. The project is designed with modularity, extensibility, and clarity in mind, enabling users to automate the entire sales data workflow—from raw data ingestion and transformation to validation, storage, and visualization.

Key strengths of this project include a clean separation of concerns, reusable and well-organized components, robust logging, and interactive Jupyter notebook support for rapid prototyping and testing. The inclusion of a single-command entry point (`main.py`) streamlines orchestration, while the clear directory structure and configuration management make it easy to adapt and extend for real-world business needs.

While the pipeline already reflects many best practices found in professional data engineering projects, it is also designed to be a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as automated testing, continuous integration, and advanced documentation. Whether you're building a prototype or deploying a production solution, Sales Analytics Pipeline provides a reliable and extensible base for actionable sales insights.

## Features

- **Automated Data Ingestion:** Seamlessly loads raw sales data from CSV files or databases.
- **Data Transformation:** Cleans, processes, and enriches data for downstream analytics.
- **Data Validation:** Ensures data quality and integrity before loading into the database.
- **Database Integration:** Uses PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and retrieval.
- **Visualization:** Generates insightful charts and reports for business analysis.
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging for pipeline execution, errors, and debugging.
- **Jupyter Notebook Support:** Test and explore pipeline modules interactively.
- **Single-Entry Execution:** Run the entire pipeline with a single command using `main.py`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL database (ensure it is running and accessible)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd sales_analytics_pipeline
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Configure your database connection:**
   Edit `src/config.py` with your PostgreSQL credentials and any other settings as needed.

## Usage

### 1. Running the Pipeline (Recommended)

Use the main entry point to run the entire pipeline:
```sh
python main.py
```
This will execute all pipeline stages: extraction, transformation, validation, loading, and visualization.

### 2. Running Individual Pipeline Stages

You can also run specific stages directly:
```sh
python src/pipeline/run_pipeline.py
```

### 3. Interactive Module Testing

Use the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder to test and explore individual modules:
```sh
jupyter notebook notebooks/exploration.ipynb
```
The notebook demonstrates how to import, test, and visualize each pipeline component interactively.

### 4. Data and Logs

- Place your raw sales data in `data/raw/sales_data.csv`.
- Processed data will be saved in `data/processed/`.
- Execution logs are available in `logs/pipeline.log`.

## Customization

- **Pipeline Stages:** Modify or extend pipeline stages in `src/pipeline/` to fit your business logic.
- **Visualizations:** Add or customize charts in `src/components/visualizer.py`.
- **Database Settings:** Update `.env file` for different environments or database backends.
- **Notebook Experiments:** Use or create new notebooks in `notebooks/` for data exploration and testing.
